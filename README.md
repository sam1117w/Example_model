An example two-stage HTA model in Excel

Please note this is an example two-stage model (Decision tree + Markov) I’ve built as part of the postgraduate degree assessment. 

Brief description of the model:
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), a potentially fatal dilation of the aorta commonly affecting males aged 60 and above, carries an increased risk of rupture with the expansion of the aneurysm.
The current cost-effectiveness analysis focuses on comparing the cost-effectiveness of the two established interventions for AAA, OSR and EVAR, utilizing a comprehensive two-stage model. The decision problem extends beyond these conventional treatments, delving into the evaluation of two hypothetical alternatives, TxA and TxB, aiming to guide healthcare decisions from the perspective of NICE, assuming a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of £20,000 per QALY.
A two-phase cost-utility analysis was conducted to evaluate the lifetime expenses and health results (measured in quality-adjusted life years or QALYs) of all four treatment options (i.e. EVAR, OSR, TxA, and TxB).
The first phase involved a decision-tree model, which accounted for the immediate costs and health outcomes within the initial 30 days following surgery. The second phase utilized a long-term Markov model extending over 20 years, capturing the sustained impact of the interventions on patient health and associated costs.
Due to the short time horizon, the model did not consider short-term health consequences associated with short-term model and short-term costs were not discounted. For the long-term Markov model, both costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% annually as per NICE’s guideline. All costs presented are in 2021 prices.
Along with a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the results of a Population Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) would also be reported – it is assumed the incidence rate of AAA is 1,000 per annum and results are calculated with a time horizon of 5 years with a discount rate of 3.5%
